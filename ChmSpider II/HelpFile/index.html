Chm files are used extensivly in the windows world for 
product documentation and help files. They are a way that you can 
encapsulate a whole host of files in one self contained browsable
database. 
<br><br>

Microsoft provides a free utility for creating and compiling Chm
files, however its interface is bulky and hard to use. Even after
reading through the documentation it takes some experimenting to 
get up and running with it. Even when you know what you are doing,
you are stuck adding files to it one by one and organizing thier
layout.
<br><br>

Chm Spider alleviates all of this hassel and generates the Chm file
layout automatically for you based on the physical directory structure
of your Files ! You can literally create a several hunred page Chm file
with one click of the button. The Chm spider interface, also shows you 
before hand the layout the of the Chm File and allows you to remove
unwanted files and folder quickly and easily. As a bonus feature, you can
also set a list of acceptable extensions to include.

Even if you have never made a Chm file before, you will have no problem
creating professional results quickly and easily.
<br><br>

Steps: 
<ol>
<li> Create all of the html files and graphics for your project. Laying out
the directory structure exactly as you want it to show up in the chm file.
<br><br>
<li>  Open up Chm Spider and either drag and drop the base project folder into
its top textbox, or use the browse for folder button next to it to load it in.
<br><br>
<li>  Edit the 4-5 options available to custom configure the Chm File.
<br><br>
<li>  Hit the "Generate Files" button, and all of the configuration scripts
needed for the chm file will be automatically generated and written to the 
project home directory. After the files are generated, Chm Spider will 
automatically open the project in the Microsoft Chm File Compiler for you !
<br><br>
<li> In the Chm compiler, just click the File -> Compile menu options, and it
will automatically generate the Chm File for you. 
</ol>

<br>
It really cant get any easier than this ! I have used this program
extensivly for my own projects and documentation needs. I created this, because
I really needed it. And everyone I have shown it...loves it too. If you have to 
make alot of Chm Files, you bascially need this program.

This software is freeware.
