So what is this thing really good for?
Why is it based completly around floppies?

I have built up this program for three specific reasons.

1) to learn and understand the FAT filesystem.
2) to experiment with how windows reads and interprets it by screwing with it :)
3) same as 2 but to see how the forensic programs deal with it and if they can
	be crashed, overflowed, or just fooled.

this brings us to the second question. Why floppies? Well floppies have a
small data area, gives us a relativly quick imaging/search times and are
disposable. We can alter them to our hearts content and never risk any data
loss and are very light on resources.

So what can we do with this?


still ughh *cough* writing this part :P

Imaging only works on NT systems

Did you know you can drag and drop floppy image files into the main form
	and have it load them?

Need a floppy image to play with? http://mycoal.mine.nu/flp.img
